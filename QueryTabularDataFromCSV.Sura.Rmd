### **Analysis of Wines**

There are a total of `r a` wines in this data set. `r round(b, 1)`% of the wines have an alcohol content over 11%. The highest alcohol content of any wine is `r c`%.

The scatter plot below illustrates the correlation between alcohol and sugar content.

```{r echo = F}
plot(df.wines$residual.sugar, df.wines$alcohol, 
     xlab = "Sugar", ylab = "Alcohol", 
     main = "Sugar vs Alcohol Content")
title(main = "Sugar vs Alcohol Content", col.main = "blue")
